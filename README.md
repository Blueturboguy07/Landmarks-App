# Landmarks App — SwiftUI Learning Project  

A small iOS app I built while learning SwiftUI, based on Apple’s Landmarks tutorial — but with my own tweaks and experiments.  

---

## What It Does  
- Lists famous landmarks with photos  
- Shows detailed views with maps & descriptions  
- Lets you favorite landmarks and filter the list  
- Works on iPhone, iPad, and macOS  

---

## Skills I Picked Up  
- **SwiftUI basics** → building declarative UI layouts  
- **State management** → using `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@ObservedObject`  
- **Navigation** → list/detail views with `NavigationStack`  
- **MapKit integration** → embedding interactive maps in SwiftUI  
- **Code organization** → breaking UI into reusable components
- **Firebase integration** → fetching and syncing data with Firestore  
- **Async data loading** → using `async/await` for smooth updates

## Creative Additions  
- Firebase-backed live data source
- 

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Swift** / **SwiftUI**  
- **MapKit**  
- **Xcode 15**  
- iOS 17+

## Notes  
Not a production app, just a playground for learning and pushing past the tutorial.
